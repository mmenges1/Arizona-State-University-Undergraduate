This was one of my favorite projects within my undergraduate degree. Our teacher provided no rubric or suggestions and asked us to create a graphic that we knew nothing about. We were asked to pick a topic and learn it from scratch from the NVIDIA GPUGems book. I chose the topic of diffraction and created the product displayed in the video. It was a real challenge, but my favorite and most rewarding challenge. Using the Visual Studio environment to build, code, and test in C#/XNA MonoGame to produce different shader, lighting, and other graphical interfaces. These approaches were used to create a real-time rendering of graphical environments.
