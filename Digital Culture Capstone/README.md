AR Battleship - Final Capstone Documentation (Capstone 2: Aug. - Dec. 2017)

This university capstone project is an AR battleship game created in Unity utilizing Vuforia that will be played on a mobile device. The player begins a game by placing 5 of their own ships on the board. 
Ideally, the ships would not be able to be placed next to each other and the player must place all 5 ships before continuing. Once the player is done placing the ships, they must then click the done button.
They will then be taken to the board where they will be given the chance to pick a place on the grid to shoot an enemy. If the player hits an enemy ship, they can continue to shoot until they miss. 
When the player misses, they are taken to the scene where the enemy tries to shoot the player’s ships. This continues until either the player hits all the enemy ships or the enemy destroys all of the player’s ships.
If the player wins, they are taken to a win scene. If the enemy wins, they are taken to a game over scene.

SurvivalVR 2 : Robot's Revenge (Capstone 1: Jan. - May 2017)

For my first senior capstone projects at ASU I was a part of a team to develop a virtual reality video game within the Unreal Engine 4 software. 
The first iteration of this project was a zombie survival shooter virtual reality game, and we wanted to take it from a stationary player into a more interactive and moveable environment for the player. 
I was a programmer on this project utilizing the C++ language to create the traps and integrate the sounds within this project.
